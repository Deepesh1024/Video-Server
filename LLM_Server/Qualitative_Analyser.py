            The metrics of the audio and video is given audio == {audio_metrics} video == {video_metrics}
            Based on this you have to produce two sections:
            1) Qualitative Remarks-Positive
            2) Qualitative Remarks-Areas of Improvement
            Apart from the the transcript, you may or may not be given information about the tone, volume, posture, gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, smile.  In either case, do not make any comments, for which you don't have adequate information provided. In particular, do not make assumptions about the audio/video if you don't have access to information regarding them.
            Be brief. Generate three-four points for each sections. (That said, when audio,video information is available, you can focus the qualitative remarks on the audio and the video significantly)

            [00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Hi, I am Shomna and I am from West Bengal.. 
[00:15.000 --> 00:24.000]  Currently pursuing my master in designing for my RSC and I have an interest in digital 
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  product design while my bachelor's in architecture. 
[00:28.000 --> 00:37.000]  I have increasingly interested in user experience and how design can impact user needs in my bachelor's degree program. 
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  And I have taken courses on user research and interaction design and visual design also. 
[00:43.000 --> 01:00.000]  So my architectural background has fostered strong user empathy and problem solving skills which are crucial to design user-centric designs. 
[01:00.000 --> 01:21.000]  The courses like interaction design which I have taken previously have equipped me with the knowledge of UI events and best practices and also have strong skills on software life which are used in the UI events world like ad-fxt, pikma and ad-ablacirator like that. [01:21.000 --> 01:35.000]  So recently I participated in a logo design competition for a cultural community at RSC where I submitted the logos with mockups like what will be the real world product with the logos. 
[01:35.000 --> 01:46.000]  For the logo design I have chosen to go with user needs and how the design language they prefer or the design language they like. 
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  So from there I have taken the design language that prefer user needs and then I designed the logo. 
[01:53.000 --> 02:07.000]  And lastly I won the competition and right now the design logo is the brand logo for theme for cultural restoration at RSC which is very proud for me. [02:08.000 --> 02:21.000]  So other than that I may not have the extensive professional experience but I am highly motivated and I am a quick learner and also eager to contribute to your team. 
[02:21.000 --> 02:36.000]  Other than that I am also a good team player and passionate about creating meaningful design solutions that are positively impact users and also in which a design user-centric based. 
[02:38.000 --> 02:56.000]  So one of my strengths is my user-centric approach. In my bachelor's degree I am trained to understand user needs, designs, places that are functional and suitable for them also enjoyable. 
[02:56.000 --> 03:06.000]  I use the same approach in UIUS design to conduct user research and then iterating based on the feedback. 
[03:11.000 --> 03:20.000]  So while I am new to the professional world of UIUS design I understand the importance of practical experience. 
[03:20.000 --> 03:27.000]  So for that I have taken some of the courses which are available in the internet like PDME, Coursera, etc. 
[03:27.000 --> 03:42.000]  And also I am practicing UIUS design side by side with my academics to build up a good and strong code for you to reach the gap in the experience.
